Make electron cover over the elements and semi-transparent  
H + H = H2
finish history
Water evoporation
add attractors to colors.png
add path to colors.png
remove H size in tin hedgehog experiment
Chemistry create parameters to named hash
Replace dots in maps with dots from colors.png with text on them
add more ions to colors.png
make borders thicker, so particles don't come through them

rearranhge tests and rename them to samples , divide into tech demoes and reactions
make forces Chemistry time adjusted
test Ionexchange
ions with holes
generalize conversion (like H+H to H2)

Test mettal as one compund body
Test solids via constraints not forces
Try constraints in molecule body
