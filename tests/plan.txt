remove H size in tin hedgehog experiment
H + H = H2
Chemistry create parameters to named hash
hinish history

rearranhge tests and rename them to samples , divide into tech demoes and reactions
make forces Chemistry time adjusted
test Ionexchange
ions with holes
generalize conversion (like H+H to H2)

Test mettal as one compund body
Test solids via constraints not forces
Try constraints in molecule body
