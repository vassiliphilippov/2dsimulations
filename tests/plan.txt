Pixi fixing plan:
* D atoms frog graphics not canvas https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50940737/how-to-convert-a-graphic-to-a-sprite-in-pixijs
* D atom rotation
* D atom flare as separate sprite
* D hiding particles
* D cash atom color and text and update texture if changed
* D opacity of particles
* D Background
* D highlights like in scenarious
* D implement non-particle bodies
* D view lookAt bounds
* D custom drawing over canvas 
* Preload textures - fix
* drawing groups
* Move atom drawing back to atom drawing

finish history
Water evoporation
add attractors to colors.png
add path to colors.png
remove H size in tin hedgehog experiment
Chemistry create parameters to named hash
Replace dots in maps with dots from colors.png with text on them
make borders thicker, so particles don't come through them

rearranhge tests and rename them to samples , divide into tech demoes and reactions
make forces Chemistry time adjusted
ions with holes

Test mettal as one compund body
Test solids via constraints not forces
Try constraints in molecule body
Place of event and backtracing
H2CO->CO2

From todo:
* H Crystals as composites
* H Finish crystals
* H Faster render via Pixi
* M update all map files to use particle images from colors.png
* Add transformation to Example 2 (H and H to H2 particle)
* L Remove previous background when add new one
* M Default chemistry option - make them a clear constant
* L Make Chemsitry parameters as hash
* L Check cloning particles confusion between position and first atom cordinates
* L Make default attractor and border options as constants
* L replace usage of Chemistry.spaceScale to convert functions everywere in the code
* L move Chemistry.spaceScale and timeScale to Chemistry options when init Chemistry
* M render optimize performance using imagepixes: http://jsfiddle.net/loktar/63QZz/ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23468218/draw-10-000-objects-on-canvas-javascript
* M move all calculations to a worker: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/offscreen-canvas  
* M implement balls and sticks drawing
* L try drawing when particle's picture is bigger than real particle 
* L cash colors calculation in render
* L rename internal functions to start with _
* L optimize performace in force calculation, replace Vector operations with x,y math
* L add more force types 
* L check if forceCoefficient is redefined in plugin (when calculating forces)
* L replace engine with World in ParticleList
* L in ParticleList, replace with sortByDistanceTo that can take both point, body and particle
* L add option to disable temperature movement
* L optimizations in temperature movement calculation if needed
* L Make transformation angular friction timeScale dependent
* L MAke better error messages (through Matter.Common.warning) and 
* L check if we need to delete the temporary image and/or the canvas in the end of ZomeMap creation
